# Progress bar Form

## React Interview Challenge #03

This Project is my particular solution to the React Interview Challenge #03 made by fernandev.

In the challenge, a form was developed. It changes a progress bar, as its fields are typed by the user. It's only possible to submit the form when all the fields are filled in. After that, the forms sends a sucess message and clears the inputs. However, the fields need to be correctly filled, in order to be validated.

Some concepts were used to put into practice:
+ Only one state was used to manipulate the entire form using the useState hook.
+ Implicit study of data structure
+ All the logic behind the features
